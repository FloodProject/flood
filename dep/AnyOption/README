AnyOption is a C++ class for easy parsing of complex commandline options. It also parses options from a rsourcefile in option value pair format. 

AnyOption implements the traditional POSIX style character options ( -n ) as well as the newer GNU style long options ( --name ). Or you can use a simpler long option version ( -name ) by asking to ignore the POSIX style options. 

AnyOption supports the traditional UNIX resourcefile syntax of, any line starting with "#" is a comment and the value pairs use ":" as a delimiter. 

An option which expects a value is considered as an option value pair, while options without a value are considered flags. 

Please read the header file for the documented public interface, and demo.cpp for an example of how easy it is to use AnyOption.
