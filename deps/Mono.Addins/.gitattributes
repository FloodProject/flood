# NOTE: this file is for git 1.6.6 (and possibly older)
# Post-1.7.2 there is eol and text, and crlf is deprecated
# but we can't depend on an unreleased version...

# This file mainly controls line ending conversion behaviour, if
# the user has the setting core.autocrlf true.

# The meaning of the attributes is a little odd
# -crlf means DO NOT convert line endings
# crlf means CONVERT to lf in the repo & Linux/Mac, crlf on Windows

# sln is always CRLF, even on linux, so don't convert
*.sln	-crlf
