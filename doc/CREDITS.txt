================

General:
	
	* Very clean and extensible OO-design
	* Uses modern C++ where possible
	* Automatic resource management
	* Easy framework for fast examples

Resources:

	* Meshes (supports Milkshape3D format)
	* Images (supports PNG format)
	* Fonts (supports TrueType and texture-based) (TODO)
	* Audio (supports Ogg Vorbis 3D and 2D playback)
	* Automatic resource management via reference counting
	* Possible to register your own resource loaders!
	
Rendering:

	* Viewing frustum culling
	* Cross-platform OpenGL renderer
	* 100% shader-driven via GLSL
	* Cross-platform windowing code
	* Material serialization format
	* Based on VBOs for fast rendering
	* Minimizes batch calls for best performance

Input:

	* Based on the idea of an abstract input device
	* Different devices: keyboard, mouse and joysticks

	* Two modes of interaction:
	
		* Event-based (callbacks / delegates)
		* Polling-based

Scene:

	* Hierarchical scene graph with BVH for fast culling
	* Different types of nodes:
	
			* Geometry
			* Camera
			* Light
			* Sound
			* Listener
			* Trigger
			* Skydome
			* Light
			
	* Built-in scene serialization to JSON format

Editor:

	* Based on wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library
	* Scene serialization support using the engine built-in support
	* Easy placement of entities with manipulators (TODO)
	* Scripting support using JavaScript (TODO)
