And the pride of the mother, was pushing her mother's son!
And the love from the father, wa used by the father's son!
Aaaaw aaaw awww aaaaw awww awww awww aaaa awww!
Overhead us talking. In a smoke of lost hope.
The language of a parting, so clear and so true.
Overhead us talking! <random talking noise>

(Very clever, Mr. Akerfeldt)
