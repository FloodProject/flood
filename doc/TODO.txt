WIP (work-in-progress)
======================

The hierarchy and types of plugins need to be better defined, and use the same interface between them all.

Types of plugins:

  Tool
  Renderer
  Asset
  Resource
  Archive
  Document

EDITOR:
-------

Terrain:
	Fix terrain painting
	Add noise terrain generation
	Use a separate VB attribute for the terrain heights
	Control resolution of terrains
	
Gizmo:
	Fix Scale and Rotate gizmos
	Make the Gizmo node transform a proxy of the original
	Get picking working properly with multiple gizmos
	When the Camera moves, mouse should be tested
	
Console:

	Clicks should not change the insertion point
	readline type of library would be kind of nice
	Write a line then go backwards and to the line again and color is white...
	
Add bounding box calculation for animated meshes
Adaptive grid in the editor
When deleting a single node from the scene tree, the Unselected event isn't sent.
	
ENGINE:
-------

Shading:
	http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/hlsl_fragments/hlsl_fragments.html

Merge mouse events
Physics rotation becomes wrong due to bounding box calculation.
Fix default animation state on skinned meshes with no animation tracks.
Meshes with alpha values need to get blending enabled.
Add code to generate a default texture

Skydome component:
	
	Separate Clouds component
	Add billboards for Sun and Moon
	Switch to triangle strips
	Fix the gradient color generation
	Add dynamic day-night system

Scene:

	Frustum class (Camera and Light integration) (WIP)
	Quadtree for fast terrain queries
	Geometry component sharing (Instancing)
	Ray query class

Scripting:

	Fix Lua state closing

Textures:
	Support DDS
	Warn and downsample if texture size is not supported
	Resize the sample to nearest-POT if rectangle textures not supported
	Generate and support MIP-maps
	Generate and support normal maps
	Combine and support cubemaps / skybox textures
	Check squish and NVIDIA Texture Tools libraries

Audio:

	Handle audio streaming for lightweight playback without consuming lots of memory

Logger:

	Fix format log time to handle minutes, hours and days
	Use truncation and close file so each log entry gets commited in each write
	The Log class should use the user writing directory for output

GUI:
	Font handling via FreeType 2
	Signed distance fonts
	Bitmap font file format (and converter for some freeware generator tool)

Rendering:

	Add Blending defaults (Modulate, Replace, etc)
	Check skinning limit in shader

linear_depth = (2.0 * znear) / (zfar + znear - exp_depth * (zfar - znear));
float kDepth = 1.0 - ( gl_FragCoord.z / gl_FragCoord.w ) / ( v_farPlane - v_nearPlane );
