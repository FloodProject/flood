vaporEngine - whats the big deal?
---------------------------------

So, vaporEngine is just a tiny KISS 3D engine I've been working on in the past few months.

The engine is divided in a few subsystems (enclosed in namespaces):

	* log (logging)
	* vfs (virtual file system)
	* math (vectors, matrices, AABBs, ...)
	* scene (scene graph)
	* render (rendering)
	* resources (textures, meshes, fonts, ...)

Rendering-related classes
-------------------------

RenderQueue

	this holds references to all the scene entities we are to render.
	it sorts them by state (materials, opacity) to minimise state changes.

RenderDevice
	
	represents the rendering device we are using. at startup the application
	can ask the user what device he wants to use (OpenGL / DirectX / Software)
	and then we create and use the device. all operations are to be done by this
	abstract class. the user of the engine doesnt need to care about details.
	this class only knows about rendering vertices/triangles and should not
	know anything about the high-level geometry primitives.
	
	each render device will also have a renderqueue and a subclass of window,
	because window implementations depend on the rendering system used. for 
	example, an opengl window will be different from an directx window.

Window

	just a class that has the window we are to render. this is abstract and will
	have a subclass for every other operating system we are to support. right now
	we are using SDL for creating and managing windows but it creates a pretty big
	dependency and should be replaced by native code once there is time to do it.

Camera

	the camera class points to what the user is looking at. it is used to configure 
	the type of projection we need and also handles the frustum culling operations.
	the camera connects with the scenemanager/renderqueue.
	
Scene-related classes

SceneGraph


WIP (work-in-progress)
----------------------

TODO:

	Simple scene graph	
	Add matrix and AABB class
	
Low priority:

	Logging functions with type-safe variable arguments
	CSS-styling to the logging output
	Implement abstract timer class
	Color copy cons and operators

Nice to have:

	Virtual File System :)
	Font handling via FreeType 2
	Basic software device
	
Done:
	
	Clean Visual Studio solutions
	Add namespaces to subsystems
	Add Milkshape model parser
	Revise Window abstract class
	Implement WindowSettings class
