WIP (work-in-progress)
======================

The hierarchy and types of plugins need to be better defined, and use the same interface between them all.

Types of plugins:

  Tool
  Renderer
  Asset
  Resource
  Archive
  Document

EDITOR:
-------

	Add support for multiple "shared" context render windows


Bugs:
	Terrains are not added properly as operations
	Fix mesh groups index buffers

GUI:
	Create widget to choose resource

Camera:
	Add an adaptive grid in the editor

Terrain:
	Add widget to switch between terrain tools
	Fix terrain painting
	Add noise terrain generation
	Control resolution of terrains
	
Gizmo:
	Fix Scale and Rotate gizmos
	Make the Gizmo node transform a proxy of the original
	Get picking working properly with multiple gizmos
	When the Camera moves, mouse should be tested
	
Pipeline:
	Add animation to FBX importer
	Add animated bounding box calculation in mesh processor
	Add FreeImage based resource importer
	Add DDS conversion to the image processor
	Warn and downsample if texture size is not supported
	Resize the sample to nearest-POT if rectangle textures not supported
	Generate and support MIP-maps
	Generate and support normal maps

ENGINE:
-------

Check out boost checked_delete for safer delete of incomplete types

Resources:
	Meshes with alpha values need to get blending enabled.
	Texture manager should provide a default texture when missing

Rendering:
	Add a shader generation system (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/hlsl_fragments/hlsl_fragments.html)
	Add Blending defaults (Modulate, Replace, etc)
	Check skinning limit in shader
	Work in lighting and shadows
	Add a proper draw call sorting system

Physics:
	Bullet bounding box conversion is wrong (extents)

Scene:
	Geometry component sharing (Instancing)
	Create an explicit query class

Scripting:
	Fix Lua state closing

Textures:
	Support DDS texture loading
	Combine and support cubemaps / skybox textures

Audio:
	Handle audio streaming for lightweight playback without consuming lots of memory

Logger:
	Fix format log time to handle minutes, hours and days
	Use truncation and close file so each log entry gets commited in each write

GUI:
	Font handling via FreeType 2
	Signed distance fonts
	Bitmap font file format

Skydome:
	Separate Clouds component
	Add billboards for Sun and Moon
	Switch geometry to triangle strips
	Fix the gradient color generation
	Add dynamic day-night system
