TextureManager
ProgramManager

OggLoader is buggy
Full-screen doesn't seem to work...
group.add(ls, snd, cam, etc);
AUDIO STREAMING? woot?
Background Resource Loading?
KeyState 1024? Hmm.
Switch to intrusive_ptr for all ref-counting classes
Create a ResourceFile class (maybe stream-based - C++ streams? )
GetLoggers for each class (could be integrated with Profiler? :)
AllocConsole for debugging porpuses on a key press

Move from #pragma error instructions to static_assert
Debug a crash in triton's desktop with an Audigy 4 (XP BSOD in Creative's driver 'ctaud2k.sys')
Move the rendering to a different thread than the main loop code (smooth resizing)
The Log class should use the user writing directory for output
Check the need for defining copy-constructors in all classes
Window size changed notifications for Camera/Viewport aspect ration calculations
Make a Localization class, potentially integrating .po files in the resource manager
The Logger should display the date and time, and not time from launch (or at least show the date it was created)
Make the Engine class take Window creation settings
The Window title should be set on Window creation, so it gets set properly on the first appearance
Make proper type-safe logger that doesn't crash with an invalid format string
Patch PhysFS to use the proper user dir for App Data on Windows
Check how the resource manager will handle missing resources
Make a Timer class and maybe a task manager with callbacks (for e.g. streaming) 
Check if/how type traits can be useful in engine
Bitmap font file format (and converter for some freeware generator tool)
Are std::string references faster/lighter than normal strings? (Yes.)
Re-check the order of initialization of the engine subsystems (ideally filesystem errors should occur _before_ rendering init)
Cross-platform Clipboard access?
FileWatcher for resource change notification integrated with VFS

Renderer:

	Font handling via FreeType 2

Resource management:

	Magic header resource type detection
	Case-insensitive comparisons in map
	

Math:

	Add matrix and AABB class
	
Platform:
	
	Implement abstract timer class (WIP)
	Log all the engine calls (WIP)
	bind/functor for logging
	Hierarchical log system
	Logging functions with type-safe variable arguments
	Logging boxes for system/CPU/GPU information

vaporEditor:

	Add Resources pane with all the resource groups
	
DONE:
-----

Vertex and index buffers
Update all the headers to have separators between different sections
Add timing code for FPS calculation and timing events.
Add Action Map class for storing input settings for the game.
Use copy-constructors or boost::non_copyable
Switch to precompiled headers (BIG GAIN!!)
Add Window events for resizing, closing, etc.
Add defines for the different compilers and switch #ifdef pragmas to those...
Simple VFS (with PhysFS 2.0)
Clean up the using std decls
Make the engine memory-leak proof
Make the memory leak detector work
Header in the log output
CSS-styling to the logging output
Implement Settings class
Clean up Window abstract class
Add Milkshape model parser
Add namespaces to subsystems
Clean Visual Studio solutions
Organize the include directories
Adapter class
