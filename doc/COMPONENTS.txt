- Entity Component-based approach -

Each entity represents a Game Entity so this is more flexible from the start,
since we are not tying the scene graph to the rendering engine. Each entity can
have different kinds of componenents depending on their needs and this a very
clean approach for extending the entities later for doing different kinds of
unplanned features. Scripting hooks can also be provided and also it can be
integrated with physics and collision detection. Input support for entities
could also be provided as a component.

	- Transform (Scale/Orientation/Translation)
	- Rendering (Geometry)
	- Animator
	- Physics
	- Scripting
	
	Advantages:
	
		- Doesn't rely on inheritance.
		- Each component can provide scripting hooks.
		- Conceptually cleaner.
		- Not tied to the rendering engine.
		- Entities don't even need a Transform if they don't need it.
		
	Disadvantages:
	
		- Hierarchical transform thing maybe harder to implement
		
	Examples:
	
		Player : Entity
		{
			Transform,
			Camera,
			Listener,
			Scripting,
			Physics
		}
	
		Camera : Entity
		{
			Transform,
			Input,
		}
		
- Node-based Scene Graph approach -

Each node is kind of a component, because if it is a group node it can hold 
other kinds of nodes, for example, a Camera node can have a child node 
(Audio Listener).

It can be transformed or not depending if it inherits from the Transformable
base node. Group node concept is used for grouping different nodes (which are
kind of components this way).

To make it easier, each node could be a group node by default, and then we can 
just add other nodes to them.
	
	Advantages:
	
		- Maybe easier to implement because it's almost half-implemented right
		now and kind of working.
		
		- Group nodes could be used to form new entities, and then the child
		nodes of those groups would become the components of them, but that
		doesn't make the most sense. Then we would get duplicated transforms
		in all the child nodes, in most cases with the default null transform
		so it would just inherit the parent transform.
	
	Disadvantages:
	
		- We don't know what child nodes of a node are forming a new entity or 
		not, because the child could be a new entity or just grouping things 
		because it makes sense but they conceptually not the same entity.
		
		- Group 
	
	Examples:
	
		Camera : Transformable
		{
			Geometry : Transformable
			Listener : Transformable
		}
